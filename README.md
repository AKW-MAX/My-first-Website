## ✨ Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **AgriVenture Enterprise** website. It serves as the primary digital interface for displaying our catalog of agricultural chemicals, pest control products, and seeds, upholding our commitment to **"Quality First."**

The application is structured as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** with dedicated components for all major sections of the website, including:

* **`Hero`**: The main landing section.
* **`About`**: Company mission and values.
* **`NewProducts` / `AllProducts`**: Product catalog displays.
* **`FeedBack` / `SignUp`**: User interaction forms.

## 💻 Tech Stack

The front-end application is built using modern web development technologies:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | Core JavaScript library for building the User Interface (UI). |
| **React Router DOM** | Handles declarative routing, enabling distinct URLs for different views (e.g., `/products`, `/about`). |
| **CSS** | For styling and layout. (Inferred from `./index.css` import). |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Core language for application logic. |

## 📂 Code Structure & Routing

The application entry point is `src/App.js`. The routing configuration is central to the site's navigation:

### 1. File Structure (Inferred)

The code utilizes a consistent directory structure for components:
### 2. Routing Logic The `App.js` file uses the `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components from `react-router-dom` to map URL paths to specific page components. Path Component Rendered Purpose  `<Hero />` Primary landing screen.`/About` `<About />` Dedicated company information page.`/AllProducts` `<AllProducts />` Full product catalog view. `/SignUp` `<SignUp />` User registration page. `/FeedBack` `<FeedBack />`Customer comments and support.*Other Paths*  Components like `<Starts />`, `<Features />` Potentially sections rendered globally or within the main content area. ## 🚀 Getting Started (Installation) To get a local copy of this project up and running for development or testing, follow these simple steps. ### Prerequisites * **Node.js & npm ** installed on your machine. ### Installation 1. **Clone the repository:** `bash git clone [YOUR GITHUB REPO URL HERE] cd agriventure-frontend ``` 2. **Install dependencies:** bash npm install # or yarn install ` 3. **Run the development server:** bash npm start # or yarn start  The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. ## 🌐 Deployment This project is a static front-end application and can be deployed easily to services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. 1. **Build the production files:** bash npm run build # or yarn build This creates a production-ready folder (usually `build/` or `dist/`) which can be served by any static host. ## 📞 Contact & Support For technical questions regarding this codebase or the website itself, please contact us Email: agneskaris26@gmail.co
